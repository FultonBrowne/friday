# Friday
because I can't think of good voice assistant names
## Goal
The same goal I had with my OG project Ara, make an inteligent assistant that can attach it slef to anything and adapt to many situations

Ara had a crap frontend, but the backend was quite nice, so I'm just writing a backend and a dead basic front end and I'll let the community take on the fancy interface
